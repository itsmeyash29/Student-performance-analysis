# Student performance analysis
This is a student performance analysis machine learning model where the performance class is categorized as Low, Medium, or High (LMH). The features used for prediction include metrics such as raised hands, resources visited, discussions, and announcement views. Other columns, like names, age, country, grade, nationality, birthplace, and parent satisfaction rate, were dropped from the analysis to focus on relevant student metrics.
# Differnt ML models are implemented and the performance of each of the models are also found out
